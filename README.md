This library is (yet another) wrapper around the iOS/Android runtime and the WASM/JS runtime, providing a singular component and ref pattern for cross-platform applications built using [react-native-web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/)

## Rive Overview

[Rive](https://rive.app) is a real-time interactive design and animation tool that helps teams create and run interactive animations anywhere. This lightweight library allows us to load our Rive animations into apps made using [react-native-web].

## Getting Started

Start by installing this package with:

```bash
yarn add rive-rnw
```

Then use it in your app like so:

```jsx
import Rive from "rive-rnw";

function App() {
	return (
		<Rive
			url="https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv"
			style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
		/>
	);
}
```

### API Documentation

This API is a superset of the official React Native Runtime API. For a detailed list of props and methods available to you and for more advanced use-cases, refer to this [documentation](https://help.rive.app/runtimes/overview/react-native/props).

üöß SOME FEATURES ARE STILL UNDER CONTRSUCTION

### Examples

An example project is provided at `/example` of this repo. It works across all platforms specified and is easy to build off of.

-   [ ] TODO: add deployed example link for reference.

## Supported Platforms

Since this library has a dependency on the [Rive React Native](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-react-native/) and [Rive WASM](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-wasm) runtimes, the supported devices align with each of these dependencies minimum supported devices, as well as the minimum device requirements of the React Native framework.

-   iOS: **14.0+**
-   Android:
    -   Minimum SDK version: **21**
    -   Target SDK version: **31**
-   Browsers: All major browsers

## Issues and Contributing

I'm constantly trying to improve this package and plan to use it for work projects at [@headout](https://github.com/headout). Please raise any issues you encounter on the [Issues](https://github.com/clearlysid/rive-rnw/issues) page.

I would also love for more people to start contributing to open-source. Any PRs with improvements, bugfixes or documentation are always welcome!

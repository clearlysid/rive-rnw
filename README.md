This library is (yet another) wrapper around the iOS/Android runtime and the WASM/JS runtime, providing a singular component and ref pattern for cross-platform applications built using [react-native-web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/).

## Getting Started

Start by installing this package with:

Then use it in your app like so:

function App() {
  return (
    <Rive
      url="https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv"
      style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
    />
  );
}
```

### API Documentation

This API is a superset of the official React Native Runtime API. For a detailed list of props and methods available to you and for more advanced use-cases, refer to this [documentation](https://help.rive.app/runtimes/overview/react-native/props).

## Issues and Contributing

I'm constantly trying to improve this package and plan to use it for work projects at [@headout](https://github.com/headout). Please raise any issues you encounter on the [Issues](https://github.com/clearlysid/rive-rnw/issues) page.

I would also love for more people to start contributing to open-source. Any PRs with improvements, bugfixes or documentation are always welcome!

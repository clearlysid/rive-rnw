A React Native Web runtime library for [Rive](https://rive.app).

This library is a (yet another) wrapper around the iOS/Android runtime and the WASM/JS runtime, providing a singular component and ref pattern for cross-platform applications built using [react-native-web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/)

## Rive Overview

[Rive](https://rive.app) is a real-time interactive design and animation tool that helps teams create and run interactive animations anywhere. Designers and developers use their collaborative editor to create motion graphics that respond to different states and user inputs. Their lightweight open-source runtime libraries allow them to load their animations into apps, games, and websites.
